# My Process

I've been spending a lot of time building apps with React lately so I decided to stick with that as opposed to just writing vanilla JavaScript. I've also been wanting to get some more practice with various UI Libraries and I thought that this would be a perfect time to get more familiar with ChakraUI.

After looking at the design images and the style guide, I decided that the `Card` component from ChakraUI would most likely be the best fit for this exercise.

I slowly started piecing everything together and kept going back to reference their documentation and then putting a little more fine-tuning into the `App.css` stylesheet that comes with `create-react-app`.
